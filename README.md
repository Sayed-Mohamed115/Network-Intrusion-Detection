üîç Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting network intrusions by leveraging supervised machine learning algorithms. Multiple classifiers were trained and evaluated to identify malicious activities within network traffic.

‚úÖ Algorithms Used
The following machine learning models were implemented and compared for performance:

Logistic Regression (LogisticRegression)

Decision Tree Classifier (DecisionTreeClassifier)

Random Forest Classifier (RandomForestClassifier)

Support Vector Machine (SVC)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighborsClassifier)

Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBClassifier)

Each algorithm was trained on preprocessed network traffic data and evaluated using appropriate classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
